## 🛡️ **Indian Cyber Risk Intelligence Agent**
 *-Developed by Srijen Gupta*

An autonomous multi-agent system built with CrewAI and Gemini 2.5 Pro designed to scout, analyze, and report on the rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape in India.

### ❓The Problem
Cybersecurity threats in India are increasing in frequency and complexity. For insurance professionals, risk analysts, and business owners, staying updated on "today's" threats is manual and time-consuming.

**The Gap: News is scattered across dozens of portals.**
**The Pain: Converting news articles into actionable "risk mitigation" advice takes specialized expertise.**

### 🚀 Our Solution
This project automates the entire "Intelligence-to-Advice" pipeline. It doesn't just "search Google"; it uses a coordinated "Crew" of AI agents to find authentic data, verify sources, and draft professional-grade reports in seconds.

### 🧠 How It Works (The 2-Agent Flow)
The system employs a Collaborative Intelligence model where two specialized agents perform a handoff:

***Agent 1***: The Cyber Scout (Research Specialist)
**Task**: Scans real-time Indian news portals and security databases using DuckDuckGo.
**Goal**: Find exactly 4 unique, recent (last 6 months) cyber incidents with authentic source URLs.
**Output**: Curated raw intelligence and verified links.

***Agent 2***: The Risk Analyst (Strategy Specialist)
**Task**: Takes the Scout's findings and performs a business impact analysis.
**Goal**: Categorize the industry, summarize the breach, and provide a "Cyber Insurance Tip" for mitigation.
**Output**: Structured JSON data formatted for the final PDF report.

### ✨ Key Features
1. BYOK (Bring Your Own Key): Secure architecture where users provide their own Gemini API key—no data or keys are stored.
2. Real-Time Search: No "knowledge cutoff" issues; the Scout agent finds news happening today.
3. Professional PDF Generation: Automatic creation of a branded report with clickable source links for authenticity.

### 🔭 Future Scope
1. Regional Language Support: Scouting news from vernacular Indian newspapers for hyper-local threat detection.
2. Advanced Sentiment Analysis: Categorizing threats by "Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt" (FUD) levels.
3. Direct Policy Mapping: Automatically linking specific breaches to real-world Indian Cyber Insurance policy clauses.
4. Historical Trend Dashboard: Storing past reports to visualize which Indian industries (FinTech, Healthcare, etc.) are being targeted most over time.
